# Songistics

## What is Songistics?
**Songistics** is a structured **workflow for songwriting**â€”combining creativity with logistics to make the songwriting process **fluid, repeatable, and intuitive.**

Itâ€™s not just a toolâ€”itâ€™s a **methodology** that helps songwriters **organize ideas, refine structure, and create great songs efficiently.** Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced musician, Songistics helps you move from **idea to finished song** with clarity and ease.

## Why Songistics?
- **Songwriting is an art, but also a process.** Songistics ensures that you never get lost along the way.
- **It provides a clear framework** while leaving space for creativity.
- **It helps identify patterns, workflows, and tools** that can be later automated and optimized.

## Current Goals
1. **Manually refine the workflow** â€“ We are testing and optimizing the Songistics methodology by manually going through the songwriting process.
2. **Identify areas for automation** â€“ As we refine the process, we will pinpoint steps that can be streamlined and later developed into a digital tool.
3. **Build a working prototype** â€“ Once the workflow is solid, we will implement the first version of Songistics as an app/tool.

## Next Steps
1. **Finalize and refine the Songistics workflow**
2. **Create example songs using the methodology**
3. **Identify automation opportunities**
4. **Develop the first prototype of the Songistics app**
